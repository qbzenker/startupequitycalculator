# ðŸš€ Startup Equity Calculator

_Because spreadsheets weren't made for unicorn dreams_ ðŸ¦„

## What is this?

A calculator that turns your hypothetical millions into actual anxiety! This tool helps founders, employees, and investors visualize the potential value of their startup equity grants across different scenarios.

Ever wondered what your 0.1% equity might be worth if your company becomes the next unicorn? Or perhaps you're just trying to justify working 80-hour weeks? Look no further!

## Features

- **Equity Value Calculation**: Input your grant details and see what your shares might be worth (or not worth)
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Model different exit valuations because optimism comes in many sizes
- **Vesting Schedule Visualization**: Watch your theoretical wealth accumulate over time
- **Mobile Friendly**: Daydream about your paper fortune while commuting on the bus
- **Dark Mode**: For when the reality of your equity value is too harsh in the light

## Why I Built This

I got tired of building the same spreadsheet over and over again every time I joined a startup or had a friend ask me "is this equity grant worth anything?" The answer is always "probably not, but maybe!" - now with `text-6xl` numbers!

Feel free to copy all the AI-generated code you want. Claude wrote most of it anyway, and it's probably better than what I would have come up with. If you build the next billion-dollar startup using this calculator, I accept thank-you notes and small percentages of equity (preferably fully-vested).

## Disclaimer

This calculator is for entertainment and educational purposes only. Any resemblance to actual startup outcomes is purely coincidental. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Your equity may be worth nothing. Or billions. Probably nothing though.

## Acknowledgements

- Shoutout to Claude for writing this README and most of the clever taglines
- Special thanks to caffeine and optimism, the two core fuels of the startup ecosystem
